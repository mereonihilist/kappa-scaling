# κ-Scaling Quantum Measurement Simulation

This repository contains simulations for the κ-scaling hypothesis in quantum measurement, using a spin-boson model and Lindblad dynamics.

## Structure
- `kappa_simulation.py`: Core simulation logic
- `data/`: Raw data from simulations
- `figures/`: Generated plots for publication
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Key Result
Measurement outcome fidelity, entanglement (concurrence), and visibility all exhibit resonance at κ ≈ 1, confirming theoretical predictions from the κ-scaling framework.
